    "text": "I’m a bioinformatician at the University of Glasgow, specialising in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with a focus on inflammation and tissue organisation. I analyse CosMx SMI datasets and build reproducible, multi-sample workflows covering quality control, integration, cell-type annotation, differential expression, and pathway enrichment, translating results into clear, testable biological insights for wet-lab collaborators.\nI hold a BSc (Hons) in Genetics (2019–2023) and an MSc in Bioinformatics (2023–2024), both from the University of Glasgow, and I draw on a strong foundation in molecular and cellular biology to work across diverse life-science questions. Alongside my research, I’ve taught R, Python, and shell scripting.\nI’m also interested in applying AI and machine learning to health research.\nCurrent interests: spatial neighbourhoods/microenvironments, differential expression & pathway analysis, and robust pipelines for multi-sample studies.\n\n\n\n\nMe!"
